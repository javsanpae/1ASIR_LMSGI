In this project you must use the three design models in order to create the
optimal code, as well as:

1. Complex Types.
    a. Empty.                                   DONE (best_vehicle_prize)
    b. Empty with attributes.                   DONE (extras)
    c. With simple content and attributes.      DONE (release_year)          
    d. With sequence of elements.               DONE 
    e. With alternative elements.               DONE (tire_design y chassis_design)
    f. With elements in no particular order.    DONE (car and motorcycle)
    g. With simple content and elements.        falta 


2. Simple Types.
    a. Predefined.                              DONE (specs_url)
    b. Built by restrictions, at least, with:
        - Range of values.                      DONE (car_plate)
        - String length.                        DONE (fullname) (car_plate)
        - Number of digits.                     DONE (car_plate)
        - Pattern.                              DONE (price)
        - Enumeration.                          DONE (brands)
    c. Built by unions.                         DONE (car_plate)
    d. Built by lists.                          DONE (car_plate)
3. Elements with minimum and maximum number of occurrences. DONE (car and motorcycle)
4. Compulsory and optional attributes.          DONE (release_year.released / extras.available)
5. Elements and/or attributes with default and fixed values. DONE (release_year.released)
6. Extensions of complex types.                 DONE (T_vehicles)
7. Groups of elements or attributes.            DONE (T_name)
