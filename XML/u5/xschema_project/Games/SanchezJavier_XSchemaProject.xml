            <description>Trouble is brewing deep beneath Caldera. Butcher has discovered once-secret laboratories where Nebula V bombs have been in production with the intent of wiping various metropolises off the map. Season Two of Call of Duty®: Warzone™ unlocks the Search and Deploy Event, where players are tasked with taking out Armored Transport trucks while infiltrating Chemical Research Laboratories before taking siege of the Chemical Factory. Take advantage of the Redeploy Balloon around Caldera to redeploy from hot engagements or from fast circling gas. And take to the air by piloting Bombers that can turn the tides of war in an instant. Season Two also brings new game features to Warzone™. Strap on your gas mask and drop in.
