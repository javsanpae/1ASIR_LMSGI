                <h1>LEVELS OF GHG (Green House Gases) IN SPAIN</h1>

                <h2>The levels of greenhouse gases have risen in Spain and all over the world if we compare the situation with how they were 80 years ago, but during these last deacdes the European Union has been working in order to reduce those levels</h2>

                <p>Here you are going to find the consecuencies and the different solutions for this harmful problem</p>

                <h3>Greenhouse gas</h3>
                <p>
                    The greenhouse gases are gases that a gas that contributes to the greenhouse effect by absorbing infrared radiation.
                    The primary greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere are water vapor (H 2 O), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), and ozone. Without greenhouse gases, the average temperature of Earth's surface would be about −18 °C (0 °F), rather than the present average of 15 °C (59 °F).
                    Human activities since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution (around 1750) have increased the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide by almost 50%, from 280 ppm in 1750 to 419 ppm in 2021. The last time the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide was this high was over 3 million years ago. This increase has occurred despite the absorption of more than half of the emissions by various natural carbon sinks in the carbon cycle,
                    some of the humans activities that increase these gas levels are the agriculture, the industries, the means of transport and the way we use and produce the energy.

                <h3>Measures to stop the increase of greenhouse gases in Spain</h3>
                <p>
                    The different countries of all over the world are adopting different methods inorder to stop this increase of greenhouse gases, for example, the Government of Spain declared a climate and environmental emergency. Although the agreement has no legal status, it will serve to accelerate climate action. In total, 30  priority lines of action will be implemented. The Executive has committed to implement five of these measures in the first 100 days of government. The most urgent, given its importance, is to submit the Climate Change and Energy Transition Bill to Parliament. The aim of this law is to ensure that zero emissions are achieved by 2050, the year in which the world should be 'free' of greenhouse gases.
                    This climate change law will include a 100% renewable electricity system, a vehicle fleet that does not emit greenhouse gases, an emission-neutral agricultural system, and a tax system that leads to decarbonization.
                </p>

                <h3>Measures to stop the increase of greenhouse gases in Europe</h3>
                <p>
                    The European Commission, presented the European Green Pact in December. The Green Pact includes the need to reduce emissions "by at least 50% and towards 55%", compared to the current target of 40%. This will require 260 billion euros of additional annual investment: "It will require the collaboration of both the private and public sectors and will mean that at least 25% of the EU budget will have to be allocated to actions against climate change".
