                <figcaption>How are humans changing the sky?</figcaption>
                
                <p>The sky is changing. For several decades, the boundaries between the layers of the atmosphere have been changing. The height of the two closest to the earth, the troposphere and the stratosphere, is being modified by greenhouse gases (GHG): while the former is expanding due to global warming, the latter is shrinking due to a parallel cooling at higher altitudes. So much change, experts believe, could affect planetary atmospheric circulation, which is key to global climate.</p>
                
                <p>The latest data on the structure of the atmosphere (recently published in the scientific journal Science Advances) confirm that the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere is rising in the northern hemisphere. The former, with a thickness of between 15 kilometers at the equator and 9 kilometers at the poles, is the lower layer of the atmosphere and where life on the planet develops. The second, about 50 kilometers high, is the layer above and, just because it includes the ozone layer, it is vital to protect everything below. The boundary between them is called the tropopause and marks the line at which the temperature no longer decreases with altitude, but increases. Although its location fluctuates with the seasons and latitude, it has been getting higher and higher since 1980, no matter where it is measured.</p>
                
                <p>The tropopause has been rising by 80 to 50 meters per decade for the past 40 years, according to this new study. The range depends on the instruments used in the measurement. Data provided by GPS satellite networks put the rise at 70 to 80 meters per decade. Meanwhile, the IGRA network, made up of two hundred radiosonde stations, several of them in Spain, reduces the rise to a figure of around 50 meters. These radiosondes, which scientists rely on most, are basically mini-meteorological stations that climb into the sky attached to a balloon and drop by parachute when the balloon bursts. In the meantime, they record basic data such as the actual temperature at altitude.</p>
                
                <p>University of Toronto (Canada) researcher Jane Liu, co-author of the research, summarizes her results: "The temperature of the troposphere has increased between 1980 and 2020, especially since 2000, and the stratospheric temperature has decreased in the same period, although the decrease has been smaller since 2000″. This translates into expansion of one layer and contraction of the other and, as a result, "the height of the tropopause is rising," Liu concludes.</p>
                
                <p>The cause of this rise of the tropopause is greenhouse gases that are warming the planet and changing the climate. This impact is different depending on the atmospheric layer. CO₂, methane and other GHGs, which are mostly concentrated in the troposphere, trap an increasing share of solar radiation. In addition to the increased radiation, as the tropospheric air warms it expands following the laws of thermodynamics. The result is the rise of the tropopause. And this is only half the story.</p>
                
                <p>Juan Antonio Añel, a scientist at the University of Vigo, has been researching the tropopause since his doctoral studies. In an article in Environmental Research published in May, he showed that, at the same time that GHGs warm the troposphere, expanding it, those same gases cool the stadrosphere, contracting it. That contraction causes the tropopause to rise further. Since 1980, the stratosphere has shrunk by 400 meters and, if the current rate of emissions continues, its thickness will shrink by another 800 meters by 2080.</p>
                
                <p>The decrease is related to the cooling of the stratosphere caused, directly and indirectly, by the same gases that are warming below. The explanation is twofold: on the one hand, the concentration of CO₂ in the troposphere causes it to trap radiation that, in its absence, would reach the stratosphere. In addition, the radiation released by the lower amount of stratospheric GHGs escapes into space as this is an optically thinner layer. "We are able not only to change the climate in the troposphere, but also to modify the entire structure of the planet's atmosphere," says Añel.</p>
                
                <p>In principle, whether the tropopause is higher or lower may have no consequences. Pablo Zurita, professor in the Department of Earth Physics and Astrophysics at the Complutense University of Madrid, recalls, however, that when this rise began to be discovered at the beginning of the century, "it was considered one of the most robust indicators of climate change".</p>
                
                <p>In the troposphere there is greater air mixing, which helps to eliminate pollutants, while in the stratosphere "there is hardly any air circulation, which is why it was so difficult to reduce the CFC gases that were damaging the ozone layer," says Zurita. This distribution of roles could be altered by changes in the tropopause. Another example, this one topical because of the eruption on La Palma, is that "only emissions from volcanic eruptions that reach the stratosphere have a global impact because in this layer the air takes longer to renew itself," says Zurita. So any changes in the boundaries between the two layers could have effects yet to be established.</p>
                
                <p>Although much research remains to be done, Añel points to its possible impact on planetary-scale air circulation: "Air masses do not rise equally around the globe. In general, they rise from the tropics and descend over the poles, reaching the tropical regions again through the lower layer. Disrupting this can have undesirable effects," he warns. In addition, the tropopause is a limit to convection, the boundary up to which clouds rise. All this could "alter the global energy balance," adds Añel.</p>
                
                <p>We included the global GPS results and they showed a lower elevation of the tropopause in the southern hemisphere."Bill Randel of the US National Center for Atmospheric Research. Questions remain to be answered. For example, is the tropopause rise a global phenomenon or is it limited to the northern hemisphere? Bill Randel is a senior researcher in atmospheric chemistry at the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and senior author of Liu's study. He recalls that his findings are limited to the northern portion of the planet because that is where there is a reliable radiosonde network. "We extended the study using global GPS data, which began to be collected in 2002. They agree well with the radiosondes for the period where they overlap. Initially, we included the global GPS results, and they showed a lower elevation of the tropopause in the southern hemisphere," he explains. However, they had to remove these measurements from the final study because other phenomena could be interfering.</p>
