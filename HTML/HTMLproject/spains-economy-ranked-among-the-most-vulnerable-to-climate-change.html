                <h1>Spain's economy, ranked among the most vulnerable to climate change</h1>
                
                <h2>Spain would lose 10% of GDP in 2050 with a severe increase in temperature. Tourism and agriculture, two of the hardest hit areas.</h2>
                
                <p>Global temperatures could rise by more than three degrees and global GDP would contract by 18% in the next 30 years, according to the Swiss Re Institute's index, which ranks Spain in 12th place among the most resilient countries.</p>
                
                <p>Climate change represents one of the greatest long-term threats to the global economy. If we do not take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, global temperatures could rise by more than three degrees Celsius and global GDP would contract by 18% over the next 30 years. Spain would lose almost 10% of its GDP in 2050 if there is a large increase in temperature. That loss would be 4.5 percentage points lower by mid-century if the increase were to be kept to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the main objective of the 2015 Paris Agreement. "Measuring the effects of climate change on the economy is complicated; we can make assumptions, but we don't have exact numbers on what might happen," says Massimo Cermelli, professor of economics at Deusto Business School. </p>
                
                <h2>Banking is highly concentrated in high-issue sectors</h2>
                
                <p>Franc Cortada, director general of Oxfam Intermón, recalls that the European Environment Agency (EEA) indicates that, with the current commitments to reduce emissions, Spain will not be able to avoid serious episodes of drought, the intensity of fires or the rise in sea levels. "And this will have effects on sectors such as agriculture, forestry, livestock and fisheries, but also on industry due to the effect of torrential rains and the flooding of its facilities or the impossibility of distribution due to the damage caused to infrastructures, and, of course, it will also directly affect tourism".</p>
                
                <p><span class="bold">Financial exposure</span></p>

                <p>Oxfam Intermón's director general adds another danger related to financial exposure. "The European Central Bank (ECB) says that countries like Greece, Portugal and Spain have the highest proportion of companies exposed to physical risks from climate change, and that 60% of bank loans are very subject to high levels of risk due to the climate emergency, but not only because of climate risks, but also because of the financial exposure of Spanish banks, which is highly concentrated in sectors with high emissions".</p>
                <h3>Spain ranks 12th among the most resilient countries, according to Swiss Re Institute</h3>
                <p>For his part, Emilio Servera, professor of the Master's Degree in Circular Economy and Sustainable Development at the International University of Valencia, argues that the most affected sectors will be those directly related to climate, especially agriculture and tourism: "Tourism faces a number of additional threats, because it will not only suffer from rising temperatures, but also from the impact on key resources such as the disappearance of snow and beaches. There will also be problems arising from extreme temperatures during the summer and the increased frequency of heat waves, which could make the country less comfortable for sun and beach tourists from northern Europe who do not want to come to the south to roast in the sun." Servera looks like to another indirect risk to tourism, flygskam, a Swedish expression meaning shame to fly, to try to help curb global warming. It is a phenomenon that is spreading in some northern European countries and may lead to fewer and fewer long-haul tourists arriving in Spain due to the carbon footprint of flights."It may be a consequence of climate change and social changes, but also of the awareness that we not only have to adapt to rising temperatures, but also mitigate them".</p>
